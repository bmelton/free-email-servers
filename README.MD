# Free Email Servers

This is a list of free email servers. It was emailed to me, and I have no idea from whence it originates, but me having it as a file on my hard drive doesn't do the world many favors, so I am adding it to git. 

## Why might I want this?

Well, if you're looking for a free email server -- just kidding, this probably isn't very useful for that. What it *is* useful for is a list of domains that you might want to block if you're building a service that (e.g.) only allows 'work' email addresses. 

Nothing is foolproof, but this is the best I can do. 

Feel free to add domains if they're missing.
